# Problem & Solution Statement


### Problem

The fundamental problem with operating within the Space Industry in Africa is the inability to develop hypersonic propulsion systems due to international pressures from defense organizations.  

The Space Age wont happen until every country and citizen on Earth can participate in the ecosystem. 


### Solution

By creating a Pan African Space Agency - the Space Africa DAO - the collective resources can be leveraged to amplify Africa's presence in the emerging space industries. With the tools created by the DAO, participants will be enabled to curate, fund and deploy space assets and infrastructure on the continent of Africa.

This solution intends to democratize access to space at a very granular level.
