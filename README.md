# EthDenver 2022 Buidlathon

This repo serves as a reference for the Space Africa DAO Buidl at the EthDenver2022 Buidlathon

### Overview

During the Buidlathon week, our team deployed a Decentralized Autonomous Organization on the Harmony One mainnet. Membership tokens were delegated to the initial governing council. Representation includes members of the team, Blockchain Foundation Africa in Ghana, and the Satoshi Center in Botswana. This effectively initialized the first Pan African Space Agency on the blockchain. 

The demo for the ecosystem is based on a digital immersive environment (metaverse), which allows participants to interact with space assets in an interactive map. The purpose of this user experience is to visualize the capital allocation and data flow for the curation and deployment of space assets and infrastructure on the continent of Africa in the real world.
